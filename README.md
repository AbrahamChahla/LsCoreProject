LightSwitch 2013 Core Project with User Mgt, Tle Menus and Self Registration

As noted in the title, this tutorial will show you how to setup a core LightSwitch 2013 project. Not just any LightSwitch project, but one that will allow User Management natively vs. having to use Web API. We'll also show you how to implement a highly configurable system that supports creating MetroUI style tile menus. Finally, it doesn't do any good if you can't deploy the application, so we will show you how with Microsoft Azure. 

I know that this is a huge tutorial, <strong>again</strong>. I did try to make it a bit more manageable by breaking it up into pages vs. one humongous post. I encourage you to go through the tutorial (at least read it) rather than just downloading and running the code, there are some items that you should understand in order to have a successful deployment.  Or Not :)

Here are the topics and their logical order:
